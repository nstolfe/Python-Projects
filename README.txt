This project was part of a portfolio project for a Computer Science professional certification from Codecademy. While the project was to design a CLI game, this portfolio project was meant to show an understanding of basic Python development as well as an understanding and utilization of Object-Oriented Programming. The project was also designed to show an understanding of utilizing Git and GitHub for version control while developing the program utilizing basic Git push and pull requests. Additionally, I took it a step further than the project requested and tried to account for possible edge cases that may occur when running the program and coding defensively to account for these situations.
